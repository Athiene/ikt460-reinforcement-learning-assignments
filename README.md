Multi-armed bandit example code

## Lecture 3

This notebook explores reinforcement learning basics, focusing on discounted rewards, environment setup, and value iteration. It defines a function to compute cumulative discounted rewards, tested with a discount factor of 0.99, yielding approximately 63.4. It contains an environment with six states, two actions, transition probabilities, and rewards is initialized. The notebook does value iteration to refine the value function and policy.
